			<h3>Quick Tutorial</h3>

			<p>This short tutorial will get you started with Flox.</p>

			<h4>Step 1: Opening Data</h4>

			<p>If you haven't yet downloaded the application, please refer to the Manual section for installation instructions </p>

			<p>First <a href="download/sampleData.zip" download>download</a> this sample data. This is a .zip file containing a sample shapefile and CSV flow data. Extract the .zip into a folder on your hard drive.</p>

			<p>Start up Flox by double-clicking Flox.exe. When Flox first starts, you will be prompted to open a CSV Flow File. Navigate to the folder where you just extracted the sample data and open sampleData.csv using the dialog. Flows will appear on the screen and arrange themselves according to the default layout settings.</p>

			<p>Next, select File>Add Shapefile Layer from the menu bar at the top of the window. Using the resulting dialog, navigate to the sample data folder and open the file with the .shp extention named countries_millerCylindrical_clipped.shp. A polygon layer of some European contries should appear.</p>

			<h4>Step 2: Modify Layout Settings</h4>

			<p>Select the Layout tab in menu at the right side of the window. You'll see several slider bars for changing the way flows are laid out on the map. For a description of what each slider does, see the Layout section of the Manual.</p>

			<p>For now, try sliding the top-most slider labeled Stiffness of Longest Flow all the way to the left to 0. This will cause the flows to initiate the layout process. A progress bar will appear towards the bottom of the menu while the flows are being layed out.</p>

			<p>Adjusting any of the sliders will initialize the layout process. Take some time to experiment with each one to see how it affects the layout.</p>

			<p>The purpose of this layout process is to prevent excessive intersections and overlapping of flows in order to make the map easier to read. Optimal layout settings will depend on the arrangement and density of the flow data. The default settings are often sufficient, but in many cases they will need some tweaking.</p>

			<p>Try adjusting the Layout settings until the flows seem to be arranged in such a way that intersections between flows are reduced and the flows are easy to tell apart.</p>

			<h4>Step 3: Manual Adjustments</h4>

			<p>Sometimes the layout settings won't be able to arrange the flows better than you can. In these cases, the flows will have to be adjusted manually. This can be done using the Select/Move tool.</p>
