				<h3>Quick Tutorial</h3>

				<p>This short tutorial will get you started with Flox.</p>

				<p>If you haven't yet downloaded the application, please refer to the Manual section for installation instructions.</p>

				<p>Also, <a href="download/sampleData.zip" download>download</a> this sample data, which you will need for the tutorial. This is a .zip file containing a sample shapefile and CSV flow data. Extract the .zip into a folder on your hard drive</p>


				<h4>Step 1: Opening Data</h4>

				<p>Start up Flox by double-clicking <b>Flox.exe</b>. When Flox first starts, you will be prompted to open a CSV Flow File. Navigate to the folder where you just extracted the sample data and open <b>sampleData.csv</b> using the dialog. Flows will appear on the screen and arrange themselves according to the default layout settings.</p>

				<p>Next, select <b>File>Add Shapefile Layer</b> from the menu bar at the top of the window. Using the resulting dialog, navigate to the sample data folder and open the file with the <b>.shp</b> extention named <b>countries_millerCylindrical_clipped.shp</b>. A polygon layer of some European contries should appear.</p>


				<h4>Step 2: Modify Layout Settings</h4>

				<p>Select the <b>Layout</b> tab in menu at the right side of the window. You'll see several slider bars for changing the way flows are laid out on the map. For a description of what each slider does, see the Layout section of the Manual.</p>

				<p>For now, try sliding the top-most slider labeled <b>Stiffness of Longest Flow</b> all the way to the left to 0. This will cause the flows to initiate the layout process. A progress bar will appear towards the bottom of the menu while the flows are being layed out.</p>

				<p>Adjusting any of the sliders will initialize the layout process. Take some time to experiment with each one to see how it affects the layout.</p>

				<p>The purpose of this layout process is to prevent excessive intersections and overlapping of flows in order to make the map easier to read. Optimal layout settings will depend on the arrangement and density of the flow data. The default settings are often sufficient, but in many cases they will need some tweaking.</p>

				<p>Try adjusting the Layout settings until the flows seem to be arranged in such a way that intersections between flows are reduced and the flows are easy to tell apart.</p>


				<h4>Step 3: Manual Flow Adjustments</h4>

				<p>Sometimes the layout settings won't be able to arrange every flow better than you can. In these cases, individual flows can be adjusted manually using the <b>Select/Move tool</b>, which is the arrow icon at the <b>far left</b> of the toolbar at the top of the window. Click it now to activate the tool.</p>

				<p>Clicking a flow line with this tool active will select the flow, making the small yellow control point visible. Click and drag the control point to change the shape of the flow.</p>

				<p>Moving the control point of a flow automatically "locks" the flow. A locked flow will not move when layout settings are changed, however it will continue to have an influence on the location of other flows. Selected flows can be locked and unlocked using the <b>Lock/Unlock Flows</b> button in the toolbar.</p>

				<p>Another tool is the <b>Move Flows That Cross Nodes</b> button at the bottom of the Layout tab. Pressing this can improve the layout.</p>


				<h4>Step 4: Creating Flow Data</h4>

				<p>You can create new flow data using the <b>Add Flow Tool</b> to add nodes and flows to the map, and you can use the <b>Select/Move Tool</b> to move existing nodes. Attributes can be added to the flows and nodes using the text boxes at the top of the window. See the <b>Manual</b> section for details about adjusting the map appearance and exporting the finished map and flow data.</p>
